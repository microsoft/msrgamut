    "fixedAcidity": "Most acids involved with wine or fixed or nonvolatile (do not evaporate readily)",
    "volatileAcidity": "The amount of acetic acid in wine, which at too high of levels can lead to an unpleasant, vinegar taste",
    "citricAcid": "Found in small quantities, citric acid can add 'freshness' and flavor to wines",
    "residualSugar": "The amount of sugar remaining after fermentation stops, it's rare to find wines with less than 1 gram/liter and wines with greater than 45 grams/liter are considered sweet",
    "chlorides": "The amount of salt in the wine",
    "freeSulfurDioxide": "The free form of SO2 exists in equilibrium between molecular SO2 (as a dissolved gas) and bisulfite ion; it prevents microbial growth and the oxidation of wine",
    "totalSulfurDioxide": "Amount of free and bound forms of S02; in low concentrations, SO2 is mostly undetectable in wine, but at free SO2 concentrations over 50 ppm, SO2 becomes evident in the nose and taste of wine",
    "density": "The density of water is close to that of water depending on the percent alcohol and sugar content",
    "pH": "Describes how acidic or basic a wine is on a scale from 0 (very acidic) to 14 (very basic); most wines are between 3-4 on the pH scale",
    "sulphates": "A wine additive which can contribute to sulfur dioxide gas (S02) levels, wich acts as an antimicrobial and antioxidant",
